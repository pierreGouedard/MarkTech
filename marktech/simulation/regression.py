# TODO: Simulation based on prediction of next high:
#   First stage: buy
#       When next high is sufficiently high => buy action
#   Second stage: sell
#       There is 4 rules to buy
#           * if price enter the target value and next high indicates it will fall
#           * if price has reached the protection value (too low)
#           * if a drop in the value is predicted.
#           * if a better opportunity exists and sufficient money has been made and lack of liquidity
#   Parameters:
#       Liquidity at start:
#       protection value in term of percentage:
#       frequency of control
#  The global parameters are => period of simulation, list of index enabled, frequency of control
